This repository demonstrates a common misconception in Ruby regarding the mutability of instance variables.  The example shows how accessing an instance variable through a getter method doesn't automatically provide a setter capability. Attempting to assign a new value through the getter does not modify the instance variable.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly define a setter method to allow modification of the instance variable.
